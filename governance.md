# Governance

[← Back to Wiki Index](./index.md)

## Small Project
This strategy is appropriate for the small size and early stage of this project. If needed, growth or change may trigger updates.

## Principles
*   **Vision-Driven**: This project is steered by the singular vision of its maintainer. We prioritize a cohesive design over broad consensus.
*   **Feedback is Welcome**: We deeply value the insights and contributions of users. Your feedback helps shape the product, even if the final decision rests with the maintainer.
*   **Open Source Freedom**: We believe in the power of Free Software and Creative Commons licenses. Users are empowered to fork and modify this software to suit their specific needs.

## Decision-Making
The maintainer has final authority over all technical and roadmap decisions. Open discussion on the `ratatui_ruby-devel` mailing list to refine ideas and share perspectives is encouraged. Consensus is not required for the project to move forward.
