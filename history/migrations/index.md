# Architecture Migrations

This folder contains documentation of major architectural migrations and refactorings.

## Completed Migrations

- **[Frame-Based API Migration (v0.5.0)](./frame_migration_v0.5.0.md)** – Transition from implicit tree-based rendering to explicit frame-based rendering, enabling precise hit-testing without layout duplication.
- **[Namespace Restructure (v0.7.0)](./v0_7_0.md)** – Reorganization of classes into modules aligned with upstream Ratatui's structure.
