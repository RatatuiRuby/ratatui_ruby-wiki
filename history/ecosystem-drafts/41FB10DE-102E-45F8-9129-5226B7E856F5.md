Here is the summary from your internal staff.

### ---

**To: CEO**

### **From: The Architect (Internal)**

**Findings:** The external consultants unanimously identified a critical constraint: The Ruby Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) and FFI safety rules make background-thread logic ("Goji Berry") a dead end. They overwhelmingly endorse the "Node.js Model" proposed by **Jujube**: synchronous logic on the main thread, asynchronous I/O on background threads. They also correctly identified that Cmd must be a structured data object (like in **Jujube**), not just a raw closure, to ensure memory safety and testability.  
**My Recommendation:** We must implement the **Jujube** specification immediately. It is the only architecture that respects the mechanical realities of the Ruby VM and the Rust FFI boundary. To ensure scalability, I will enforce the inclusion of **Apple’s** Cmd\#map method (for component composition) into Jujube’s codebase. I am also flagging the poll\_event(timeout:) requirement as a P0 blocker for the core engine team.

**To: CEO**

### **From: The Project Manager**

**Findings:** The "Batteries Included" debate was settled by the users (Angie and Troy). If we ship a "pure" framework without standard commands for Shell Execution (Cmd::Exec) and HTTP (Cmd::NetHttp), adoption will flatline. **Jujube** and **Fig** were the only specifications that respected this requirement. The consultants also highlighted the risk of "God Reducers," which we must mitigate via the "Fractal Architecture" pattern.  
**My Recommendation:** Adopt **Jujube** as the scope baseline. It has the most complete feature set (Batch, Tick, Exec) which allows us to market the framework as "production-ready" for v1.0. I am scheduling the implementation of the "Glimmer Hook" (Msg::FieldUpdated) for Phase 1 to prevent a rewrite in Q2 when we launch the DSL.

**To: CEO**

### **From: The Product Owner**

**Findings:** We have two distinct customer personas: the "Rails Developer" (Rainier) who wants structure, and the "Script Writer" (Troy) who wants speed. **Ichigo** proved we can serve both with a flexible API ("Callable Objects"). **Fig** nailed the marketing pitch: "The Standard Architecture" (Model \= DB, Update \= Controller). The "Functional Programming" branding is toxic to our Rubyist growth targets; we must sell this as "Organized OO."  
**My Recommendation:** Build **Jujube**'s technology, but wrap it in **Fig**'s narrative. We will position ratatui\_ruby-tea not as an Elm clone, but as "Rails for your Terminal." We will prioritize the Cmd::Exec and Cmd::Batch features because our user research (Angie) shows these are the "Hello World" for real-world CLI tools.

**To: CEO**

### **From: The Technical Writer**

**Findings:** The biggest risk identified by the panel is complexity creep. If the documentation leads with "Monads" or "Endofunctors," we lose the audience. **Ichigo's** examples were the clear winner for clarity—showing a single-file script *and* a multi-file app side-by-side. The "Fractal Pattern" (composition) is critical, but it needs a simple recipe, or users will write unmaintainable code.  
**My Recommendation:** I request permission to discard the academic tone of the original specs. I will write the documentation based on **Ichigo’s** "Script vs. App" structure, applying **Fig’s** "Rails" analogies. I will explicitly document the "Fractal Pattern" as "Component Composition" (a term Rubyists know) rather than "Fractal Architecture" (a term they don't). We are documenting **Jujube**, but we are speaking **Ruby**.
