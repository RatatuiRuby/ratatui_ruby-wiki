Subject: [PATCH] ratatui_ruby v0.7.4 released

ratatui_ruby v0.7.4 is out.

This release adds Block#inner, session state tracking, and fixes direct
text rendering.

## Added

Block#inner(area) computes the usable content area inside a block,
accounting for borders and padding. Essential for layout calculations.

RatatuiRuby.terminal_active? indicates whether a TUI session is active.
Calling init_terminal while a session is already active now raises
Error::Invariant.

Error::Invariant is a new error class for state invariant violations
(e.g., double-init). Distinct from Error::Safety (lifetime violations)
and Error::Terminal (operational I/O failures).

Deferred Warnings: Experimental feature warnings are now automatically
queued during active TUI sessions and flushed to stderr after
restore_terminal. This prevents warnings from corrupting the TUI
display.

## Fixed

Text::Line and Text::Span can now be rendered directly as widgets via
frame.render_widget(line, area) without wrapping in a Paragraph.
Previously, these text primitives were silently ignored.

Text::Line alignment: parameter is now respected during rendering.
Previously, alignment was ignored and text always rendered left-aligned.

No other breaking changes.
