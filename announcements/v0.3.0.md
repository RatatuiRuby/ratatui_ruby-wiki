Subject: [ANN] ratatui_ruby v0.3.0 released

I have released ratatui_ruby v0.3.0.
It simplifies how you build terminal interfaces.
You can now write widgets in Ruby and control every part of the screen.

What is new:

* **The Escape Hatch.**
  You can now write custom widgets in pure Ruby.
  Implement the `render` method to draw strings directly to the buffer.
  You no longer need Rust for custom components.

* **Clear Widget.**
  The `Clear` widget wipes a part of the terminal.
  It resets the buffer so background colors don't leak into your modals.
  Use it to create opaque popups.

* **Interactive Tables.**
  Tables now handle selection.
  Use `selected_row` to track users.
  Highlight the active line with `highlight_style`.
  Building an interactive grid is now simple.

* **Scrollable Paragraphs.**
  Paragraphs now scroll in any direction.
  Long logs and documents now fit into small windows.

* **Center Widget.**
  The `Center` widget no longer clears the background.
  It is a layout tool.
  You can layer transparent widgets with confidence.
