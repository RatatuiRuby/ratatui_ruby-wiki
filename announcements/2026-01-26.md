Subject: [ANN] rooibos v0.6.0 (beta) and ratatui_ruby 1.0, 1.1, 1.2

I am happy to announce rooibos v0.6.0 alongside ratatui_ruby v1.0.0 (stable),
v1.1.0, and v1.2.0.

## rooibos v0.6.0 (beta)

Confidently build terminal apps.

Rooibos helps you keep your code understandable and testable as it scales.
It handles keyboard, mouse, and async work so you can focus on behavior and
user experience.

Get started in seconds:

    gem install rooibos
    rooibos new my_app
    cd my_app
    rooibos run

You have a working app with keyboard navigation, mouse support, and clickable
buttons. Open `lib/my_app.rb` to make it your own.

Rooibos uses Model-View-Update, the architecture behind Elm, Redux, and Bubble
Tea. State lives in one place. Updates flow in one direction. The runtime
handles rendering and runs background work for you.

Features:

* **Message-driven.** Events and command results become messages. Update handles
  them uniformly.
* **Immutable models.** State changes produce new models. The test helper
  validates this for thread safety.
* **Async commands.** HTTP, shell, timers, file open, and batch. All run off
  the main thread.
* **Custom commands.** Write your own with `Command.custom`. `out.put` outputs
  results. `out.source` outsources work. `out.standing` stands up streams that
  remain outstanding until you outwait them.
* **Fragments.** Compose large apps from smaller pieces. Each fragment has its
  own Model, View, Update, and Init.
* **Router DSL.** Declarative keymaps and child fragment routing.
* **CLI scaffolding.** `rooibos new` generates a gem with a working app and
  test infrastructure ready to go.
* **Testable.** Unit test Update/View/Init without a terminal. Plus the event
  injection, test terminals, and snapshot testing you know from RatatuiRuby.

## ratatui_ruby v1.0.0 (stable)

The API is stable. No breaking changes until 2.0.

What is fixed:

* **Terminal Deadlocks Resolved.**
  Calling terminal queries (`viewport_area`, `poll_event`, etc.) or mutations
  (`insert_before`, `set_cursor_position`) from inside a `draw()` block
  previously caused silent freezes. Queries now work via a snapshot captured
  before rendering. Mutations raise `Error::Invariant` with a clear message.

* **TableState Row Navigation.**
  Added `select_next`, `select_previous`, `select_first`, `select_last` for
  row navigation. These match `ListState`'s API.

## ratatui_ruby v1.1.0

What is new:

* **Terminal Capability Detection.**
  New class methods on `Terminal` for environment-based detection:
  `Terminal.tty?`, `Terminal.dumb?`, `Terminal.no_color?`,
  `Terminal.interactive?`, `Terminal.color_support`. Query capabilities
  before initializing TUI mode.

* **Alignment Constants.**
  New `HorizontalAlignment` and `VerticalAlignment` modules with discoverable
  constants (`LEFT`, `CENTER`, `RIGHT`, `TOP`, `BOTTOM`).

* **Frame Count Query.**
  `RatatuiRuby.frame_count` returns frames drawn since terminal initialization.

* **Mouse and Resize Symbol Comparison.**
  `Event::Mouse` and `Event::Resize` support symbol comparison via `to_sym`
  and `==`. Use `event == :mouse_left_down` or `event == :resize`.

* **Key Event DWIM Predicates.**
  Arrow key aliases (`arrow_up?`, `up_arrow?`) distinguish keyboard input from
  mouse events.

* **Generated RBS Predicates.**
  New `rake rbs:predicates` generates RBS declarations for all 1,328
  `Event::Key` predicate methods.

## ratatui_ruby v1.2.0

What is new:

* **Inline Sync Mode.**
  `SyntheticEvents.inline_sync!` enables deterministic ordering of sync events
  with key events. Runtimes that need ordering guarantees (like Rooibos)
  should call this at startup.

Installation:

    gem install rooibos

Or, if you prefer to manage state yourself:

    gem install ratatui_ruby
