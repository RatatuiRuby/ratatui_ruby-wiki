Subject: [ANN] ratatui_ruby v1.0.0-beta.1 released

I am happy to announce the release of ratatui_ruby v1.0.0-beta.1. This release
is functionally identical to v0.10.3. The version number is the change. Why 1.0?
The library is stable. Projects like Sidekiq are building on it. The API has
settled into patterns that work. Calling it 0.x no longer reflects reality.

The beta label means the API is stable but untested at scale. We need real-world
usage to surface edge-case bugs. The 1.0.x API will not change. Minor versions
(1.1, 1.2) will add new features and add more upstream Ratatui alignment.

**New website:**

RatatuiRuby now has a home on the web: https://www.ratatui-ruby.dev. Browse
documentation, examples, and guides in one place.

**What comes next:**

The 1.0.x patch releases will receive bugfixes. Minor versions (1.1+) will bring
upstream alignment and new APIs. Development of Rooibos, the functional runtime
for Model-View-Update applications, continues in parallel.

See https://www.rooibos.run for more about Rooibos. If you are developing a
complex application, consider using Rooibos instead of RatatuiRuby directly.

**I need your help:**

I need your help to make this release a success. Please try out the library and
report any bugs you find. I am also looking for feedback on the API
documentation, guides, and examples. I want to make sure that your experience as
a developer is the best it can be.

If you find bugs, please report them: https://todo.sr.ht/~kerrick/ratatui_ruby

Your feedback shapes the 1.0.0 final release.

Installation:

gem install ratatui_ruby --pre

Or in your Gemfile:

gem "ratatui_ruby", ">= 1.0.0.pre, < 2.0.0.pre"
